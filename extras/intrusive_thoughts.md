### I think I was a DEI hire, and I am fine with it

Basically that. Now that I do some retrospective, my time in silicon valley was an opportunity that I got because of DEI. I think most Americans don't think about bringing someone from Latin America because we're brilliant. Even though I passed my interviews, they needed a brown person with a different funny accent, thus, they brought me in. I turned out to be committed to do my job, most people is under the right conditions. Yet I think under different circumstances, like the current ones, the only spot for a person like me is standing outside home depot rather than doing "engineering" in an office in Santa Clara, California.

Can't complain, won't complain, I got the offer of a better future and I took it. Best job ever, best 5 years ever, I learned a lot, I had a lot of growth, I got spoiled.

### The Bay Area is awesome, shut up

White people will complain about how awful the Bay Area is, that all those junkies in the buildings and on the streets make the place shallow and wild. Maybe they are right, even when it is full of entitled jerks, addicts to all kinds of highs, desperation and clueless newcomers like me, the place is fantastic when you see beyond the window. The geography of the place is nothing short of blessed. Everything around it is simply majestic. 

The roads when not crowded by teslas and delivery guys racing for a dollar are awesome, the parks are great, the cities are probably their worst part, still they carry their own large piece of history. Yes, technology made the place a weird place, the social and wealth gap is abysmal, the lack of a sense of community is depressing, yet all these are human problems caused by selfish humans and the place remains a jewel, and it left me a lot of great memories that I still cherish and all it needed from me was a walk outside or a drive to a beach.

### Homogenous hierarchies kill cultures

When I decided to leave my former job, besides that I got tired of USCIS busting my balls at every chance, was quite related to what our culture became at some point. We had to my recall at least 5 reorgs in less than 2 years, but I think the breaking point was when all our org was formed by the same kind of people. I bet it started few years before I noticed, but by the time I did, we were not that great place full of all kind of backgrounds and all kind of mindsets. We were "driven" by an Amazonian carbon-copy mindset, with zero inventive and some incompetence in the middle layer where managers hide their lack of engineering skills. Not fun, would not recommend, ever.
