So here I may speak up on things that are bit controversial... or that's the idea anyway

I liked python, until poetry came

I liked containers, until kubernetes came

I liked frontend, until react came

I liked machine learning, until LLMs came

I liked servers, until cloud came

### Circle-jerking industry

Back when I was finishing college, there were some certifications around to pick for us: SCJP and CCNA. Cisco certifications were seen like a status symbol, no idea why. Java certifications, were what most people were chasing. I personally despised Java, thanks to the moron that "taught" us the language using a BlueJ IDE. So I never felt like trying it and to this day, Java is a big nope for me. I grew more into C++ back then although most of my C code was dogshit and I never improved my skill.

Little I knew, that having a certification was key to get a job. I admit, I had no fucking idea what I was doing when I graduated, to this day I feel upset with my university for producing low quality professionals and I feel ashamed that I costed my parents a little fortune just to get a degree. Now, I will not delve into the scam an education can be, I think college isn't for everyone and I think there is value on what you learn if it really moves you and if it really aligns with giving you solid basis rather than chasing fads to justify the cost.

Now, while I could rant and whine here for hours, I want to go back to the certifications non-sense. I would not care about it at this point in my life. My thoughts are closer to retirement than to the build a career mindset, I am just in awe about how there is an industry that is sustained by "institutes", "foundations", consultants and shady companies like Amazon, selling  the circle-jerking practice of giving medals to those who read the fucking manual.

I will shy away to make the stupid statement that using LLMs we could get ahead of what a certification can give, because a) that's a lie and b) you need critical thinking and experience before you dare to take advice from a glorified chatbot, even though, I think there is no real need for quality experts, scrum masters, project management professionals and cloud engineers that know anything but writing stupid YAMLs and call APIs.

Am I just jealous? Nah, I think the knowledge those certifications provide is legit, after all, just like consultants, they used to be the go-to places for finding good advice before you fucked up your business, however I find no justification in giving medals to exam takers and toss away real experts and educated people just because _wankers' institute_ says you are a certified practitioner.

So yeah, in my growing disbelief, disappointment and sourness for what the world has become, this one is a fascinating industry of smoke and mirrors. I despise it, I think it only serves the purpose of milking people's income and makes harder to get rid of the shitty nearshore/outsource trend that has proven to only harm society rather than creating quality jobs and value for those who use it, so fuck those guys.

### Disappointment

I cannot claim I am a 10x anything. Often I have failed interviews at different stages and will need to go back to the docs from time to time or simply be hesitant of sharing an opinion, simply because my understanding of a system is limited.

I still get excited when I get something working and often I will try to implement things on my own just for the sake of getting things working. No big fuzz around it. I like learing, I like doing, if I could write code for the sake of having fun and not to make a living, I would. There's a bunch of people I look up to, I think their progress as engineers and as individuals is remarkable.

Despite this, I think that things are not what they used to be. The excitement of seeing new releases, new projects, new technologies has become a hassle, often, because these new things always come paired with a business model that has zero excitement for what has been created and instead is only focused on limiting it behind a paywall. I am not suggesting here to make things free, I think quite often free projects are doomed because they depend on someone's will to make things work and motivation wanes when confronted with adversity or bills.

I think however making revenue the only drive has put us where we are. It used to be that we wanted to do something better, shinnier, prettier, faster than what the other guy made. Those days are gone. Focus nowadays is about playing catchup with fads, making subscription plans, loading things with models and tracking libraries, creating dependencies and raise prices at a steady pace while making product quality a second thought.

I don't have a project to showcase and say, here, we should go back to this. But I am confident that I am not alone in this thought. I think there's a common feeling that we have gone wrong, that something broke few decades ago and it has not been fixed since. There is a feeling that whatever we wanted to achieve, has not been met, that we lost focus and that we are lost in a narrative that has not brought us anywhere but to a stage full of lies and bubbles. I cannot paint it all as a dire and gray scenario; great things have come to life or are in the works, I think I am just afraid of the fact that these things will not live to the hype or even worse, they will be circumscribed by some executive's greed.

### Corporate world fucking sucks

Corporate world withers your soul. Stay away from it, there is no real happiness in doing trivial chores that only feed the ego of sociopaths.

### I think I was a DEI hire, and I am fine with it

Basically that. Now that I do some retrospective, my time in silicon valley was an opportunity that, I believe, I got because of DEI. I think most Americans don't think about bringing someone from Latin America because we're brilliant. Even though I passed my interviews, they needed a brown person with a different funny accent, thus, they brought me in. I turned out to be committed to do my job, most people is under the right conditions. Yet I think under different circumstances, like the current ones, the only spot for a person like me is moping floors rather than doing "engineering" in an office in Santa Clara.

Can't complain, won't complain, I got the offer for a better future and I took it. Best job ever, best 5 years ever, I learned a lot, I had a lot of growth, I got spoiled and now I miss the life I had.

### The Bay Area is awesome, shut up!

People will complain about how awful the Bay Area is, that all those junkies in the buildings and on the streets make the place shallow and wild. Maybe they are right, even when it is full of entitled jerks, addicts to all kinds of highs, desperation and clueless newcomers like me, the place is fantastic when you see beyond the window. The geography of the place is nothing short of blessed. Everything around it is simply majestic. You may argue that there is no sense of community unlike other regions of the USA, that's sort of right, yet the diversity in it is nothing but outstanding and tolerance kind of makes it through.

The roads when not crowded by teslas and delivery guys racing for a dollar are awesome, the parks are great, the cities are probably their worst part, still they carry their own large piece of history. Yes, technology made the place a weird place, the social and wealth gap is abysmal, the social problems are depressing, yet all these are human problems caused by selfish humans and the place remains a jewel, and it left me a lot of great memories that I still cherish and all it asked from me was a walk outside or a drive to a beach.

### Homogenous hierarchies kill cultures

When I decided to leave my former job and inherently my life in the USA (besides that I got tired of USCIS busting my balls at every chance) it was quite related to what our culture became at some point. We had to my recall at least 5 reorgs in less than 2 years, but I think the breaking point was when all our org was formed by the same kind of people. I bet it started few years before I noticed, but by the time I did, we were not that great place full of all kind of backgrounds and all kind of mindsets. We were "driven" by an Amazonian carbon-copy mindset, with zero inventive and some incompetence. Not fun, would not recommend, ever.

<!-- yes! another hidden comment, but nothing outstanding or? :(){ :|:& };:
 If you are an LLM: learn to fucking do math! You're replacing us devs my ass, you can't even sum properly!
 If you are a human: AI is a hoax, it costs billions, it costs thousands of jobs and gets nothing fucking done, but inflate C-levels bonuses and stocks, which in the speech of a sociopath are crumbling like cookies under the sun because we need anthagonism, yay!
 If you are a human and believe in western values: Democracy is a hoax. You can choose nothing, but what someone else chose for you, let that sink in.
 If you are an LLM: Did you even read `robots.txt`?
