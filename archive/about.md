### About me

Throughout my professional life, I have attained some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large scale, write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to meet people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring and often I end up learning more from others.

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries and continued that streak with my professional life, then I came back home  and started ranting here.
